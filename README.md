# Analysis
 I developed a movie review analysis project using Natural Language Processing techniques. The project involved pre-processing the text by removing stop words and punctuation, and extracting features using a lemmatizer. I trained a Naive Bayes classifier using NLTK and explored using other machine learning classifiers in scikit-learn. The project allowed me to gain experience in text classification and machine learning, and I evaluated the performance of the model using appropriate metrics.
