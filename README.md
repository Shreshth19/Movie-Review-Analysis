# Movie-Review-Analysis
 I developed a movie review analysis project using NLP, removing stop words and punctuation, and extracting features using a lemmatizer. I trained a Naive Bayes classifier using NLTK and explored using scikit-learn classifiers. I gained experience in text classification and evaluated the model's performance using appropriate metrics.
